Programming in C
"""
This function lets the user pick a specific C-language topic.  
Once a topic is selected, the LLM tailors its explanations, code-snippets and troubleshooting hints directly to that C concept, giving the learner exactly the help they need.
"""

Digital Electronics
"""
By choosing a digital-electronics topic, the user receives focused LLM-generated content—Boolean algebra, K-maps, flip-flops, counters, etc.—streamlined to the selected sub-field instead of a broad overview.
"""

Computer Organization
"""
This function allows the learner to select a precise computer-architecture subject (e.g., pipelining, cache design, instruction sets).  
The LLM then delivers in-depth explanations, diagrams and examples targeted to that exact area.
"""

Data Structures
"""
Users pick the exact data-structure topic they want to master.  
The LLM responds with tailored walk-throughs, complexity analyses and implementation code for the chosen structure (arrays, trees, graphs, etc.).
"""

C++ Programming
"""
Selecting a C++ sub-topic triggers the LLM to generate focused guidance—be it OOP, STL, templates or memory management—so the user gets concise, relevant assistance rather than a generic C++ lecture.
"""

Operating System
"""
With this selector, the learner drills down to a single OS concept (scheduling, memory management, file systems, etc.) and receives LLM-generated explanations and examples crafted specifically for that concept.
"""

Database Management System (DBMS)
"""
Picking a DBMS topic (normalization, SQL tuning, transactions, etc.) prompts the LLM to return targeted insights, queries and best-practice tips aligned to the precise database issue at hand.
"""

Software Engineering
"""
The user chooses a software-engineering theme (SDLC, design patterns, agile, testing).  
The LLM then delivers concise, context-aware guidance and case studies tailored to that engineering practice.
"""

Computer Networks
"""
By selecting a networking topic (TCP/IP, routing protocols, HTTP, etc.), the user receives LLM-generated explanations, packet diagrams and troubleshooting steps customized to the chosen network layer or protocol.
"""

Web Technology
"""
This function lets the user zero in on a web-tech subject (HTML5, CSS3, React, REST APIs).  
The LLM responds with targeted tutorials, code snippets and deployment tips focused on that exact web component.
"""

Java Programming
"""
Selecting a Java topic triggers the LLM to produce focused content—be it collections, concurrency, Spring or JVM internals—ensuring the user gets precise help for the chosen Java area.
"""

Artificial Intelligence
"""
Users pick an AI sub-field (search algorithms, knowledge representation, NLP, robotics).  
The LLM then generates targeted theory, algorithms and code examples specific to that AI domain.
"""

Machine Learning
"""
By choosing a particular ML topic (regression, clustering, boosting, etc.), the user receives LLM-curated explanations, math derivations and runnable code tuned to that exact machine-learning concept.
